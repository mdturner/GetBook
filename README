GetBook is a Python script to create epub ebooks or .book files and folders (see http://bencrowder.net/blog/2010/06/md2epub/) from the online texts made available by the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship at Brigham Young University (http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/).  

Requirements:
* Python (2.5 or newer, I think)
* ÂµTidylib (http://utidylib.berlios.de/)

Instructions:
The book is specified by using the bookid from the book's url, e.g. for _Temple and the Cosmos_ (http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=103), the bookid is 103.  The script will ask the user for the bookid, or it can be passed as an argument.
